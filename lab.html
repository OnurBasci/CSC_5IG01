    <h2>Lab Homework 1: Setup Blog</h2>
    <p>
        This week I set up the blog. I decided to use Github Pages for that. Since I have not done any web development,
        I created this page with the help of chathpt.
    </p>

    <h2>Lab Homework 2: Setup Unity:</h2>
    <p>I already had some experience with Unity so Unity was already set up on my PC. I use Unity version 2022.3.10.f1.</p>

        This week I decided to create a bowling seen. To do that I created the scene by using set of cubes.
        <img src="./images/cube.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
        I also created some material to make the scene colorful.
        <img src="./images/materials.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="200">
        I also added pins as cylinder objects. Here is the scene
        <img src="./images/scene.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
        Finally I added colliders to bowling ball, floor and pins, and added rigidbody components to bowling ball to have a dynamic scene. 
        Here is the result.
