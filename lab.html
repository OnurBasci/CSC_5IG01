    <h2>Lab Homework 1: Setup Blog</h2>
    <p>
        This week I set up the blog. I decided to use Github Pages for that. Since I have not done any web development,
        I created this page with the help of chathpt.
    </p>

    <h2>Lab Homework 2: Setup Unity:</h2>
    <p>I already had some experience with Unity so Unity was already set up on my PC. I use Unity version 2022.3.10.f1.</p>
    <p>
        This week I decided to create a bowling seen. To do that I created the scene by using set of cubes.

        I also created some material to make the scene colorful.
        <img src="./images/materials.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="200">
        I also added pins as cylinder objects. Here is the scene
        <img src="./images/scene.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
        Finally I added colliders to bowling ball, floor and pins, and added rigidbody components to bowling ball to have a dynamic scene. 
        Here is the result.

    <h2>Lab Homework 3: Unity Roll-A-Ball</h2>

    <p>
        This week I followed Unity's roll a ball tutorial. Since I have already some experience with Unity, the implementation was 
        pretty straightforard and I did not encounter any particular problem. Here is a scene from my implementation.
        <img src="./images/roll_a_ball/roll_a_ball.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="600">

        I wanted to make this project more interesting so I added some obstacle to the scene. I created a prefab called "bomb", with a sphere
        collider and a rigidbody.
        <img src="./images/roll_a_ball/bomb.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
        The mechanic is that if the player toches the bomb, player uses 2 points. The bomb also becomes red if the player 
        hits it. Here is the code for that.
        <img src="./images/roll_a_ball/bomb_code.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
        Finally I putted some obsticales on the scene.

    <h2>Lab Homework 4: Unity Roll-A-Ball in VR</h2>
    <p>
      This week I implemented the VR version of Roll-A-Ball. I haven't worked with Unity VR before so this was a new experience for me.
      I had a little bit difficulties to associate meta application with meta quest therefore I could not work in real time with Unity.
      I had to build the apk file and send it to the meta quest for each time I wanted to test the algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started by creating the scene and setting the camera. I did not use the default Unity camera but I used OVRCameraRig.
      <img src="./images/vr/camera.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
      Then I exported my roll a boll project and imported it to my vr project.
      <img src="./images/vr/roll a ball.png.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
      I decided to implement a direct selection method to be able to hold the roll a ball platform and move the ball by rotating my hand.
      To do that I added a sphere collider to right and left hand controller. I also adjusted the layers in a way that the platform only detects
      collision with hand devices.
      <img src="./images/vr/controller.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
      And here is the logic of my selection technique.
      <img src="./images/vr/code.png" alt="Description of the image" width="800" height="400">
      Finally I build the final project and I was able to select and rotate the platform with the hand devices. I have to say that the game
      became much more interesting!

    <h2>Lab Homework 5: Selection Pitch</h2>

    <p>
        This week I and Jean-Loup presented 2 selection techniques: selection by filtering and selection by Portls,
        after the presentation, we discussed with the professor and decided to implement portal selection.

    <h2>Lab Homework 6: Selection technique Implementation</h2>

    <p>
        This week I and Jean-Loup presented our project. The details are explained in Jean-Loup's blog.
