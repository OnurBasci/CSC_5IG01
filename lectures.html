    <h2>Lecture Homework 1: VR Fails</h2>
    
    <h3>Scenario 1: Collisions with Furniture or Walls</h3>
    <p>One common problem with VR headsets is that users can easily lose awareness of their surroundings, leading them to accidentally walk into walls, tables, or other furniture. This could result in injuries or property damage.</p>
    <p>To address this issue, I would enhance the existing "Guardian Systems" found in many VR headsets. These systems allow users to define a safe play area, and when they approach the boundary, a virtual grid appears.</p>
    
    <h3>Scenario 2: Collisions with Other People</h3>
    <p>Another issue arises when a bystander unknowingly enters the VR userâ€™s play area, creating a risk of collisions that could harm both parties. The VR user, fully focused on the virtual environment, is often completely unaware of the person entering their space.</p>
    <p>To overcome this, I would suggest implementing real-time bystander detection using the headset's external cameras or depth sensors. If someone enters the designated play area, the system could display a translucent silhouette of the person within the VR environment, making the user immediately aware of their presence.</p>
    
    <h2>Lecture Homework 2: CAVE System</h2>
    <p>The primary difference between the CAVE system and head-mounted displays (HMDs) lies in how they deliver the virtual experience. The CAVE system uses multiple large projection screens to create an immersive environment that users can enter, allowing for collaborative experiences where several individuals can share the same virtual space without wearing cumbersome gear. In contrast, HMDs are personal devices worn on the head, offering a highly immersive and portable VR experience tailored to the individual. CAVE systems excel in providing a natural sense of spatial awareness, as users can freely move within a physical space, and they avoid the discomfort or isolation often associated with wearing HMDs. However, they are expensive to set up, require significant physical space, and lack portability. On the other hand, HMDs are more accessible and affordable, making them ideal for individual use or gaming, but they can feel isolating, limit collaborative interactions, and sometimes cause motion sickness due to their reliance on screens close to the eyes. Each system has its strengths, with CAVEs better suited for collaborative and professional environments and HMDs more practical for personal and entertainment applications.</p>
